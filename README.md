# CalculatorGUI.py
Creating an easy and funtional Calculator GUI
This is a simple calculator project implemented in Python using the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a button interface.

Features
Simple and user-friendly graphical interface created with Tkinter.
Performs basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Supports decimal operations (with the dot button).
Displays the result of the operation when the = button is pressed.
Error handling: If an invalid operation is entered, the program displays an "Error" message instead of crashing.
Main Functions
Add numbers and operators: The user can click the corresponding buttons to add numbers and operations to the ongoing calculation.
Evaluate the calculation: When the = button is pressed, the calculation is evaluated and the result is displayed.
Clear the screen: The user can clear the operation and result by pressing the clear button, resetting the calculator for a new calculation.
Clear and accessible interface: The interface is simple with a clear display of numbers and operations.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (typically included with Python)
Installation
Clone the repository or download the .py file.

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using the following command (in most cases, Tkinter is included with Python by default):

bash
Copiar código
pip install tk
Run the program from your terminal or Python editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code):

bash
Copiar código
python calculator.py
